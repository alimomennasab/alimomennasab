### Hello world! 👋
I'm Ali Momennasab, an incoming freshman studying computer science at Cal Poly Pomona! I have interests in deep learning (particularly in healthcare applications) and IOS app development.

- 🧘 I'm currently working on Stance, a posture-improvement app that uses augmented reality to suggest neck stretches.
- 🤖 I'm currently improving my deep learning skills to eventually become good enough to pursue novel research.

If you want to reach out, please DM me on Twitter at @momennasabali. Happy to answer any questions or collaborate!
