### Hey! ✌️
I'm Ali Momennasab, an incoming freshman studying computer science at Cal Poly Pomona! 
 
I have interests in deep learning (particularly in healthcare applications), IOS app development, and everything in between.

- 🤖 I'm currently improving my deep learning skills to eventually pursue novel research in healthcare.

If you want to reach out, please DM me on Twitter at [@MomennasabAli](https://twitter.com/MomennasabAli). Happy to answer any questions or collaborate!
