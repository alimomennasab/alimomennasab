I'm Ali Momennasab, a sophomore studying computer science at Cal Poly Pomona. I have interests in deep learning in healthcare applications, IOS app development, and everything in between.

Right now, I'm growing my [deep learning skills](https://github.com/alimomennasab/ChestXRay-Classification) while improving Cal Poly Pomona's class registration portal at [BroncoDirectMe](https://github.com/BroncoDirectMe).

If you want to reach out, please DM me on Twitter at [@MomennasabAli](https://twitter.com/MomennasabAli). Happy to answer any questions or collaborate!
