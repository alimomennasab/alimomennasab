### Hello world!
I'm Ali Momennasab, an incoming freshman studying computer science at Cal Poly Pomona! 

I have interests in deep learning (particularly in healthcare applications) and IOS app development.

- ðŸ§˜ I'm currently working on [Stance](https://github.com/alimomennasab/Stance), a posture-improvement app that uses augmented reality to suggest neck stretches.
- ðŸ¤– I'm currently improving my deep learning skills to eventually pursue novel research in healthcare that helps others.

If you want to reach out, please DM me on Twitter at [@MomennasabAli](https://twitter.com/MomennasabAli). Happy to answer any questions or collaborate!
