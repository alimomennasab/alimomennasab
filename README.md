### Hey! ✌️
I'm Ali Momennasab, a freshman studying computer science at Cal Poly Pomona! 
 
I have interests in deep learning (particularly in healthcare applications), IOS app development, and everything in between.

Right now, I'm growing my deep learning skills while building an improved class registration portal for Cal Poly Pomona at [BroncoDirectMe](https://github.com/BroncoDirectMe).

If you want to reach out, please DM me on Twitter at [@MomennasabAli](https://twitter.com/MomennasabAli). Happy to answer any questions or collaborate!
